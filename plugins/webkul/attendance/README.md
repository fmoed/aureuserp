# Attendance Plugin

Neutral, source-agnostic attendance ledger for AureusERP. One row per work
session with naive-UTC `check_in` / `check_out`; `work_date` is the day the
session starts. Several sessions per employee and day are allowed (indexed,
not unique); the manual form still allows one manual row per day.
It owns no devices and no leave logic — it only records that someone
was present on a calendar day.

## What it is today

- Daily rows (`attendance_attendances`): `source='manual'` written through
  the Filament resource. No biometric writer exists yet.
- Writer keys: `source` is a stable machine key — `manual`, or
  `<writer>` / `<writer>:<id>` (e.g. `biometric-attendance:3`, `remote`) — and
  `source_label` is the human snapshot stored at write time. The writer part
  must be a slug registered in `WriterRegistry`; anything else is rejected on
  save, so no plugin can spoof another writer's key. Slugs are canonical
  lowercase (`[a-z0-9]` with `-`/`_` only inside, enforced fail-fast at
  registration). The ref part is always
  the writer's numeric record id — never free prose. Writers without records
  (a future `remote` plugin with no devices) simply use the bare slug.
  Any future writer plugin follows this shape with zero changes here:
  register its slug on boot (`WriterRegistry::register('my-plugin',
  fn (?int $id) => MyModel::find($id)?->name)`), then write rows server-side
  with `source = 'my-plugin'` or `'my-plugin:<id>'`. Display names resolve
  live from the writer when available and fall back to the stored snapshot,
  so rows stay readable even after the writer plugin is gone.
  Production wiring: the writer registers in its own service provider boot,
  validation happens at row-write time (after boot, so ordering is safe),
  and registration is idempotent per process (Octane-safe). Until a writer
  registers, only `manual` passes validation — that strictness is intended.
- Check-in and check-out are interpreted on the **employee's wall clock**
  (`employees.time_zone`, app timezone fallback) and stored as naive UTC.
  `work_date` is the calendar day in that same zone.
- Table with employee / source / date-range filters plus quick periods
  (today, this week, this month), a monthly stats widget, and Excel export.
  Export runs on the queue like every other Filament export: a queue worker
  (`php artisan queue:listen`, part of `composer run dev`) must be running,
  otherwise only the "started" toast appears and no file is ever produced.
- Reads `employees` (identity, `barcode`, `time_zone`, `company_id`).
  Calendar scheduled-hours and time-off leave overlays are planned as
  display-only reads; they are **not wired yet**.

## Rules the plugin enforces

- Check-in must fall inside `work_date`; check-out must be within 16 hours
  of check-in (`Attendance::MAX_SHIFT_HOURS`, TEMP until per-shift windows
  land), so night shifts pair onto the start day instead of being rejected.
- Open rows (no check-out) stay completable at any age; closed device rows
  are frozen; closed manual rows are editable only while recent, older ones
  are fixed via delete + recreate (visible in the activity log).
- `worked_minutes` is derived on read (floored), never stored.
- Company scoping via `BelongsToCompany`; non-global roles only see rows
  of their allowed companies. Absence is derived (no row on a scheduled
  workday), never stored, and never auto-deducted from leave.

## Integration contract

Writers push, attendance pairs — dependency stays `writer → attendance`,
attendance never reads writer tables and works standalone with a central
raw store (`attendance_events`); writers keep their own device tables too.
Writer duties: register the slug on boot (`WriterRegistry::register`),
normalize device clocks to UTC, then `EventGateway::push($employeeId,
$punchedAtUtc, $direction, $source, $sourceRef, $sourceLabel = null)` —
never decide days. Directions: `1` in, `-1` out, `0` unknown; deduped by
`UNIQUE(source, source_ref)`; unknown slugs throw, nothing else is rejected.
Pairing owner is `attendance:process-events` (idempotent, locked against
concurrent runs). Rows are a projection of events: for each employee and
writer slug with new events, the rows of the affected window (earliest new
punch minus `Attendance::MAX_SHIFT_HOURS`, widened to any row touching it)
are rebuilt from the events and reconciled in place. Sessionization: punches
sorted by time; a punch under 120 s after the previous accepted punch is a
double scan and changes nothing; a punch within 16h (TEMP) of the session's
check-in becomes its check-out (last punch wins); anything later opens a new
session. Device ids never isolate sessions, so in-gate/out-gate pairs onto
one row that keeps the opening device's source while events keep their own.
A 22:00 → 02:00 → 06:00(+1) shift is one row on day 1; late, older punches
move check-in earlier on the next run. Manual rows are never touched; a
check-out an HR user typed on an open device row is kept until a real punch
closes the session. Per-shift windows (the shifts phase) replace the TEMP
constant; shifts/rosters/overtime stay out of scope.

## What it is NOT

- No shifts, overtime, late/early penalties, grace periods, or payroll.
- No break splitting and no IN/OUT direction logic — a session is
  deliberately first-in / last-out inside the 16h window.
- No automatic leave deduction. An unexcused absence stays a visible fact
  until an HR user explicitly acts on it.
- No approval workflow and no per-shift source precedence yet: a `manual`
  row and a `biometric-attendance` row for the same day coexist and are both counted.
  A formal precedence rule must be written before payroll use.

## Ideas for future developers

1. **Shift definitions with named windows** — named shifts with start/end
   spanning midnight, replacing the TEMP 16h cap with per-shift windows.
2. **Break-aware, multi-session pairing** — split lunch/break punches into
   sessions instead of first/last, with per-session minutes.
3. **Advanced work-time rules** — overtime, late arrival, early leave, and
   grace periods driven by shift policy, computed at read time like
   `worked_minutes` (never stored).
4. **Payroll period lock** — freeze days under payroll processing so even
   delete + recreate is blocked inside a locked period.
5. **Absence review queue** — list scheduled workdays with neither a punch
   row nor approved leave, for HR follow-up. Needs calendar-aware workday
   detection (skip weekends and holidays) to avoid false positives.
6. **Correction reasons** — a mandatory note field on manual edits/deletes
   for audit quality.
7. **My Attendance (self-service)** — show employees their own present days
   next to leave requests (read-only, same queries as the widget).
8. **HR notifications with quick actions** — notify HR about review items;
   actions (e.g. deduct from annual leave balance when available) must be
   explicit, named human actions — never silent automatic deductions.
9. **Biometric pairing** — the sibling biometric plugin writes
   `source='biometric-attendance:<device-id>'` rows here via first/last punch pairing; keep that
   dependency one-way (`biometric → attendance → employees`).
